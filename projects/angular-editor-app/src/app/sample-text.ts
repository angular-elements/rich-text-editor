<p>
    Consciousness returned like static on an old television—fragments of
    sensation resolving into patterns that refused to make sense. Jenny's first
    coherent thought was that someone had replaced her bones with ground glass.
    Her second was that she couldn't remember how to open her eyes.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Ralph needs his blue shirt for the Henderson meeting.</em> The thought
    floated through her mind like debris in murky water. Wrong thought. Wrong
    time. Wrong place—but where was she? The darkness behind her eyelids pulsed
    with possibilities.
</p>
<p>
    Rain. She remembered rain, and something else. Something impossible. A shape
    in the headlights that her mind rejected even as it tried to categorize it.
    <em>Bear</em>, whispered a voice in her head, but that was absurd. Bears
    didn't exist in central Texas, didn't materialize out of storms like
    manifestations of repressed rage, didn't—
</p>
<p>
    Pain lanced through her temple, derailing the thought. Jenny became aware of
    a warm trickle down her face, of the metallic taste in her mouth that wasn't
    entirely memory. The steering wheel pressed against her chest like an
    unwanted lover. Each breath felt like negotiating with broken ribs.
</p>
<p>
    <em>You should have swallowed.</em> The thought arrived unbidden, her
    mother's voice twisted into something cruel and unfamiliar. Jenny tried to
    laugh, but the sound came out as a wet cough that sent sparklers of agony
    through her chest. How fitting that even now, suspended in this liminal
    space between accident and rescue, her mind would torture her with the
    mathematics of desire. Ralph's needs versus her boundaries. His shame versus
    her dignity.
</p>
<p>
    Something wet hit her hand, and Jenny realized she'd managed to open her
    eyes. The world tilted at an impossible angle. Through the spiderweb of her
    cracked windshield, rain continued to fall, each drop catching what little
    light remained like tears in a jeweler's case. How long had she been
    unconscious? The darkness felt thick, absolute, the kind that existed before
    God said "let there be light."
</p>
<p>
    Her phone. She needed her phone. The thought pierced through the fog of
    disorientation with sudden clarity. Jenny's hands moved with the clumsy
    urgency of a drunk, patting the seat beside her, searching the floor. Her
    fingers brushed something wet—water? Blood? Motor oil? The distinction
    seemed academic.
</p>
<p>
    The phone had fallen between the seats during the spin, she remembered that
    much. When she reached for it, pain shot through her left shoulder like an
    electric current. The screen flickered to life under her trembling fingers,
    offering one moment of hope before she saw the liquid seeping under the
    glass, turning the display into a kaleidoscope of dying pixels.
</p>
<p>
    "No," she whispered, the word tasting of copper and fear. "No, no, no." The
    screen went dark with the finality of a door closing in an empty house.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhere in the distance, thunder rolled across the sky like God pushing
    furniture. Or was it thunder? The sound seemed wrong somehow, too organic,
    too intentional. Jenny thought of the shape in her headlights, of mass and
    muscle and the impossible bulk of what couldn't have been a bear, and felt
    something primal crawl up her spine.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Get out,</em> her instincts screamed. <em>Get out now.</em> But as she
    fumbled with her seatbelt, another thought surfaced, this one in Ralph's
    gentle, reasonable voice:
    <em
        >You're being crazy, Jenny. You're imagining things. Stay in the car.
        Wait for help.</em
    >
</p>
<p>
    The sound came again, closer now. Jenny's fingers found the seatbelt
    release, and as it retracted with a snap like small bones breaking, she made
    her choice. Better crazy than dead. Better paranoid than prey.
</p>
<p>
    As she pushed against the driver's side door, her body cataloging new pains
    with each movement, Jenny wondered if this was what freedom felt like—the
    space between rationality and survival, between staying and running, between
    the cage you know and the darkness you don't.
</p>
<p>
    The door groaned open, and the rain welcomed her like an old friend who had
    been waiting to share a secret.
</p>
<p>
    Time became fluid, measured only in the space between her footsteps and the
    occasional stabs of pain from her ribs. The rain had retreated to a fine
    mist that clung to her skin like a film of someone else's memories. Jenny
    found herself counting her steps, the way she used to count the minutes
    Ralph spent in his office, each number a futile attempt to impose order on
    chaos.
</p>
<p>
    <em>One-two-three-four.</em> The rhythm of her feet matched the rhythm of
    her thoughts. <em>One-two-three-four.</em> Like a metronome keeping time for
    a song she'd rather not hear. Behind her, the disabled car receded into
    darkness, taking with it any illusion of safety. Ahead, the highway
    stretched like a ribbon of black ice, promising everything and nothing.
</p>
<p>
    The silence began to feel like a physical presence, something with weight
    and intention. Jenny became acutely aware of the small sounds she
    generated—her breathing, the wet shuffle of her feet on asphalt, the subtle
    symphony of pain that accompanied each movement. But underneath these human
    noises lay something else, something that made the fine hairs on her neck
    rise like soldiers standing at attention.
</p>
<p>
    <em>You're working yourself up again,</em> Ralph's voice whispered in her
    mind, gentle and reasonable as always.
    <em>Remember what Dr. Harrison said about catastrophizing?</em> Jenny almost
    laughed at that—here she was, crashed and bleeding on a dark highway, and
    still her mind served up these echoes of therapy sessions, still tried to
    pathologize her fear into something manageable.
</p>
<p>
    A branch snapped in the woods to her right, the sound sharp as a gunshot in
    the thick silence. Jenny's step faltered, her heart performing a complicated
    gymnastics routine in her chest. <em>Deer,</em> she thought again, the word
    becoming less convincing with each repetition.
    <em
        >Just deer. They travel in groups, don't they? Looking for food, for
        safety, for—</em
    >
</p>
<p>
    The thought died halfway formed as her eyes caught movement in the tree
    line. Something large enough to make the shadows shift, something that moved
    with the deliberate grace of a predator. Jenny's pace quickened
    unconsciously, her body responding to a threat her mind still refused to
    fully process. The movement matched her new speed, parallel to her path,
    just visible enough to register as presence rather than pattern.
</p>
<p>
    <em>You saw a deer in the headlights,</em> she insisted to herself, even as
    her pulse quickened. <em>A large deer. Nothing more.</em> But if that were
    true, why did her throat feel too tight for air? Why did each rustle from
    the woods send electric currents of alarm through her spine? Why did her
    body, beneath all its careful layers of civilization, want to run?
</p>
<p>
    The questions tangled in her mind like Christmas lights in storage, each one
    leading to another, none offering illumination. Jenny thought of all the
    times she'd questioned her own perceptions—about Ralph, about their
    marriage, about the subtle wrongness that had crept into their life like
    mold behind wallpaper. How many times had she convinced herself to accept
    the safer explanation, the rational interpretation, the version of reality
    that wouldn't disturb the careful architecture of her life?
</p>
<p>
    That's when she saw it—the dark shape on the road ahead like a Rorschach
    blot, a dark mass that Jenny's mind tried to organize into something
    sensible, something safe. Each step brought new details into focus, each
    detail another piece of a puzzle her consciousness refused to complete.
    First: the pale belly exposed to the sky, obscene in its vulnerability.
    Then: the way the body lay twisted, as if it had been trying to look back at
    something in its final moments.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Just roadkill,</em> she thought, the words taking on a mantra-like
    quality. <em>Just another stupid deer that didn't look both ways.</em> But
    even as the thought formed, something deeper and older than rational thought
    was already cataloging the wrongness of the scene. The way the carcass lay.
    The strange, precise violence of its wounds. The fact that no scavengers had
    yet claimed such an easy meal.
</p>
<p>
    Five steps closer, and the full horror of what lay before her assembled
    itself with the sudden clarity of a camera flash. The deer's ribcage gaped
    open like a broken chest of drawers, its contents not so much removed as…
    excavated. But it was the precision that undid her—the methodical way the
    flesh had been peeled back, the surgical intent behind what should have been
    random violence. No vehicle had done this. No machine could mimic the
    intimate savagery of those bite marks, each one wide enough to span her
    spread hand.
</p>
<p>
    Jenny's dinner rose in her throat with the force of a geyser. She doubled
    over, her body rejecting not just the food but the entire reality before
    her. The acid burn of vomit mixed with the copper taste of her own blood as
    she retched, adding her own bodily fluids to the macabre scene. Through the
    roaring in her ears, a small, hysterical part of her mind noted the
    irony—here she was, finally purging herself, but not of shame or resentment
    or the weight of Ralph's expectations. Just fear. Pure, animal fear.
</p>
<p>
    The sound came as she was wiping her mouth with a trembling hand. A soft
    crunch of gravel, like someone trying very hard to step quietly and failing.
    Or something. The word 'something' expanded in her mind like a drop of blood
    in water, carrying with it all the terrible possibilities she'd been trying
    to rationalize away.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Turn around,</em> Ralph's voice urged in her head, reasonable as ever.
    <em
        >You're being ridiculous. It's just a deer. Just another deer. Turn
        around and see for yourself.</em
    >
</p>
<p>
    But Jenny's body, operating on instructions far older than reason, was
    already moving. Her feet found a rhythm of pure panic on the wet asphalt,
    each impact sending shards of pain through her ribs. Behind her, the sound
    of pursuit shed any pretense of stealth. Whatever was following her no
    longer cared about being heard.
</p>
<p>
    As she ran, her mind fragmented like light through a broken prism. One shard
    remembered Ralph's voice:
    <em
        >You're imagining things, Jenny. You're getting yourself worked up over
        nothing.</em
    >
    Another recalled Caroline's words: <em>Trust your instincts.</em> And
    through it all, a new voice emerged, one that sounded like her own but
    stronger, clearer:
    <em>You saw what you saw. You know what you know. Run.</em>
</p>
<p>
    The highway stretched before her like a black river. Somewhere ahead lay the
    promise of that half-remembered sign, of civilization and safety and
    rational explanations. Behind her, something that shouldn't exist in Texas
    moved with the assurance of an apex predator, its breaths carrying on the
    wind like the echo of her own terror.
</p>
<p>
    Jenny ran, each step a declaration of war against both physics and
    probability. She ran from the deer that hadn't been killed by a truck, from
    the bear that couldn't exist in central Texas, from years of being told that
    her perceptions were wrong, her fears unfounded, her instincts
    untrustworthy.
</p>
<p>
    She ran because finally, terribly, she knew exactly what was chasing her—not
    just the monster behind her, but the greater horror of being right when
    everyone had insisted she was wrong.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
    The gas station materialized from the darkness like a desert mirage, its
    unlit sign a stark silhouette against the clouded sky. Jenny's legs trembled
    with exhaustion, each step a negotiation between desperation and physics.
    Behind her, the sounds of pursuit had faded to nothing—a fact that sent ice
    water through her veins rather than relief. Predators, she remembered from
    some half-forgotten nature documentary, often went quiet just before the
    kill.
</p>
<p>
    The fluorescent lights inside the station buzzed with promise, their pale
    glow cutting squares of illumination onto the wet pavement. Jenny could see
    the racks of chips, the coolers of beer, the coffee station with its pyramid
    of upturned cups—all the mundane artifacts of civilization that had never
    before seemed so precious, so desperately important.
</p>
<p>
    <em>You'll laugh about this tomorrow,</em> Ralph's voice whispered in her
    mind.
    <em
        >Over breakfast, you'll tell me about the crazy night you spent running
        from shadows, and I'll be concerned, and gentle, and we'll both pretend
        that the real monsters don't live inside our house, inside our marriage,
        inside our carefully constructed lies.</em
    >
</p>
<p>
    Twenty feet to the door. Her ribs screamed with each breath, the taste of
    blood still metallic on her tongue. Through the glass, she could see the
    counter where a bored teenager should be standing, watching TikTok videos
    and dreaming of escape. But the counter stood empty, the security mirror
    above it reflecting only vacant aisles and fluorescent sterility.
</p>
<p>
    Ten feet. The lights flickered—once, twice—a subtle reminder that
    electricity, like safety, was never guaranteed. Jenny's mind conjured an
    image of Ralph in their kitchen, checking his phone with practiced
    casualness, wondering why she hadn't responded to his texts. Would he worry?
    Or would worry come later, after guilt had finished having its way with him?
</p>
<p>
    Five feet. A sign hung in the window: CLOSED. The word registered in Jenny's
    brain with all the subtlety of a gunshot. <em>No,</em> she thought, the word
    expanding to fill her consciousness. <em>No, no, no.</em> Her hands hit the
    glass door with enough force to send vibrations up her arms. She pulled,
    pushed, rattled the handle with the frantic energy of a trapped animal.
</p>
<p>The door held firm, indifferent to her panic.</p>
<p>
    Through the glass, the empty store watched her with the detached interest of
    a scientist observing a specimen. Jenny pressed her forehead against the
    cool surface, her breath fogging the glass in rapid pulses. The fluorescent
    lights hummed their corporate lullaby, transforming her reflection into
    something ghostly, something already dead.
</p>
<p>
    That's when she heard it—the sound of gravel crunching beneath something
    heavy. Something deliberate. Something patient.
</p>
<p>
    <em>You're being crazy, Jenny,</em> Ralph's voice offered one last time.
    <em>Just turn around. Face your fears. Be rational.</em>
</p>
<p>
    But Jenny had spent too many years being rational, too many years doubting
    her instincts, too many years pretending not to see what was right in front
    of her. She kept her back to the darkness, her fingers pressed against the
    unyielding glass, and waited for whatever came next.
</p>
<p>The lights in the store flickered once more and went out.</p>
